This is a first iteration code for use in exporting a CSV and a JSON file for evaluating your Sleeper league's playoff scenarios.

You'll have to enter your league's ID and specify the start week you'd like to use (it's likely that the start week will still take into account accrued wins/losses, even if the start week entered is before the current week). 

Playoff outcomes are simulated between every matchup for the remaining weeks, with each outcome represented 50/50. Then the current points scored per user are used as a tiebreaker. It also accounts for divisions and creates reports on byes, if present. It will lastly create values for any time a user is "ousted" by another due to the points tiebreaker and allow you to evaluation who you need to catch up to for making the playoffs most.

Thanks for checking this out and feel free to comment or recommend changes!
